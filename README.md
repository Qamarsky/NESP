# NESP
NESP R files

This repository is to hold all of the R files that Chris and Qamar will be working on for the NESP project. 

###### Here is the url on how to use GitHub and RStudio together ####
#### note that you have to open a shell to add in new branches ###
### http://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/ ###


Create a branch for changes so they are self-contained. There is also no way to do this within RStudio so we are going to enter additional commands in the shell to create it:

 `git checkout -b proposed-fixes master`

### Once you have made changes, go to the GIT icon in the menu bar and commit changes. 

## once changes are finished, open shell and type 'git push origin proposed-fixes' (Note that
# proposed-fixes is the name of the branch you chose when you originated this branch)
